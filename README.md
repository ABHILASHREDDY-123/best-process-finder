# Best process finder

**Objective:**

To find the best possible algorithm  having the least average wait time for a given number of processes.

**Methodology:**

For the given n number of processes the average waiting time is calculated based on 4 different scheduling algorithms

The 4 algorithms taken into consideration are
1. First come first serve                                                                                                                          
2. Shortest Job first                                                                                                                                           
3. Longest Job first                                                                                                                                                 
4. Round Robin                                                                                                                                                      

The algorithm having least average wait time is considered to be the best algorithm

--> If the inputs are given in a wrong format, that is if the number of arrival times given does not match the number of burst times the interface identifies it and shows that input is invalid.

--> We implemented all of the 4 CPU scheduling algorithms in C++

--> We made a web interface and  all the algorithms are linked using Javascript 

--> For a given input of arrival times and burst times the user can directly get the output of the average wait times of each process and also the best possible algorithm.

--> Styling of the web interface is done using bootstrap.

**WARNINGS:**                                                                                                                                                         
-->When the number of arrival times and number of burst times are not same we alert “Input is wrong” 

-->When no input is given in arrival times and number of burst times we alert “Enter a valid input”.
